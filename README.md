# Cloud based application for economic load dispatch

## Abstract
Conventional economic load dispatch systems encounter challenges such as computational intensity, data storage limitations, slow real-time responsiveness, difficulty in collaborative optimization, security concerns, insufficient scalability for changing power system capacities, and high upfront costs. We present a cloud computing-based solution
powered by Amazon Web Services for tackling these challenges. Cloud computing addresses these issues by providing scalable resources, efficient data management, real-time
processing, secure collaboration, and cost-effective solutions. Our framework includes
three systems: ”Economic dispatch without constraints”, ”Economic dispatch considering Generator Limits” and ”Economic dispatch considering all constraints” We converted these systems into Python code and deployed them
on AWS Lambda by creating two different Lambda functions, along with other dependencies. And analyzed their performances. The real-time data were also stored in a database
called DynamoDB.

## Introduction

An essential aspect of the economic operation of power generation and distribution involves
the principle of economic dispatch, striving to minimize the cost associated with power production. Under specified load conditions, economic dispatch plays an important role in determining the power output for each plant, including individual generating units within those
plants. The primary objective is to minimize the overall cost of fuel required, to meet the system load. Essentially, economic dispatch entails orchestrating the distribution of production
costs among all operational power plants within the system.

## Problem statement and proposed solution
Conventional economic load dispatch in power systems struggling with several challenges,
ranging from computational intensity to real-time decision-making constraints. The complexity of optimization problems and the vast amounts of data generated by power systems
often strain the computational capabilities of traditional setups, leading to prolonged processing times. Additionally, issues related to data storage, management, and security pose
significant hurdles.
Cloud computing emerges as a transformative solution, offering scalable and on-demand
computational resources to accelerate the optimisation procedure. The cloud’s robust data
storage and management capabilities address concerns related to the efficient handling of
large datasets. Real-time decision-making is enhanced through the cloud’s ability to process
data swiftly. Moreover, cloud platforms facilitate collaborative optimization among multiple
stakeholders, overcoming geographical and infrastructural barriers. Security and reliability
concerns are mitigated by the substantial investments made by cloud providers in safeguarding data. The scalability of cloud computing ensures adaptability to changing power system
